It is simple that displays the various flights around the world. The information it displays are time of flight, airport information, aircraft identity, country where the airport is located.
With this web app you search the flight data by country and request for flight in the past.
It has an authentication process to keep track of the users. To be able to use it, I advice you use any of the social logins provided. Dont you use your email and password option for now. This feature will come up in later updates.
